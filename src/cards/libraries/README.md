# Library Card Data

This folder contains the logos, colour schemes and known barcode types used by each public library in Libraree.

Look at [libraries.json](https://github.com/cpwood/Libraree/blob/main/src/cards/libraries.json) to understand the mappings between the images and their services.

All images are 400 x 400 in dimension and are PNGs.
